# CFCT application using Angular 7 and Laravel 

Child Focused Community Transformation (CFCT) is a model for transformational development. At the heart of the CFCT model is the welfare of the most vulnerable population in most societies – children. FH’s expertise in multi-sectorial food security programs, and a desire to see children thrive in key relationships within healthy families and communities. This will permit them to reach their God- given potential while they grow.

The application was developed using Angular 7 and Laravel for PHP.
